# Wallpaper Birthday Automation


<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ArnoAlford/Wallpaper-Birthday-Automation/blob/master/Capture2.PNG">I always forget birthdays, so I wanted to make a program that did the remembering  for me in the least obtrusive way I could think of. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" src="https://github.com/ArnoAlford/Wallpaper-Birthday-Automation/blob/master/Capture3.PNG"> The program keeps a dictionary of name and birthday pairs, compares the dates against today's date and then filters the results to birthdays happening in the next 3 days.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="right" src="https://github.com/ArnoAlford/Wallpaper-Birthday-Automation/blob/master/Capture4.PNG"> The program then opens the current active windows wallpaper, edits in the text, saves the file and updates the registry so that the changes take effect.
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The end result is a simple program that, when filled with names and birthdays, can be scheduled in Windows task scheduler and be completely left alone. No boxes to look at, no prompts, no input. If someone's birthday is occuring in the next 3 days you get a soft reminder on your wallpaper and that's it.
